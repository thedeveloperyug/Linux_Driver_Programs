# Linux Device Driver Programs

Welcome to the **Linux Device Driver Programs** repository! This repository contains a collection of device drivers written for the Linux kernel. These programs serve as examples and educational resources for understanding and developing Linux kernel modules and device drivers.

## Introduction

Device drivers are essential components of the Linux kernel, enabling the system to interact with hardware devices. This repository contains various examples of Linux device drivers, from basic "Hello World" modules to more advanced drivers interfacing with hardware.

## Header Files

Each Linux device driver program in this repository utilizes various kernel header files. Below is a list of commonly used header files in the programs:

- **`<linux/module.h>`**: Provides the core functions and macros needed to create a loadable kernel module, such as `module_init` and `module_exit`.
- **`<linux/kernel.h>`**: Contains kernel-specific functions and macros, including logging functions like `printk`.
- **`<linux/init.h>`**: Used for module initialization and cleanup functions.
- **`<linux/fs.h>`**: Provides the file system interface and structures such as `file_operations`.
- **`<linux/uaccess.h>`**: Used for safely copying data between user space and kernel space.
- **`<linux/cdev.h>`**: Provides character device registration functions and structures.
- **`<linux/gpio.h>`**: Provides functions and macros for interacting with General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins.
- **`<linux/interrupt.h>`**: Used for handling hardware interrupts.

Each programâ€™s directory contains a `README.md` file specifying the exact header files used.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up your environment to compile and run the device driver programs in this repository.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have the following installed on your Linux machine:

- **Linux Kernel Headers**: Required for compiling kernel modules.
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)


### Step-by-step Program Execution

Each program is contained in its own directory. Navigate to the directory of the program you want to compile:

```bash
  mkdir Driver
  cd Driver
  touch first_drive.c Makefile
  
- **Examine the Source Code**


Before compiling, you may want to review the source code. Each program typically includes a .c file and a Makefile. The .c file contains the driver code, and the Makefile defines how to compile the module.

 ```bash
        sudo make first_drive.c
        
This will produce a .ko file (e.g., hello_world.ko), which is the compiled kernel module.
